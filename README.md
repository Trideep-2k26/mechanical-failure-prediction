# Mechanical Failure Prediction Using Vibration Data

## Overview

This project predicts the condition of rotating machinery (healthy vs. faulty) based on vibration data using machine learning algorithms. It uses Random Forest as the machine learning model and a dataset containing vibration, temperature, RPM, and operating time data.
